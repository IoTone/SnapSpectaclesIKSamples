## Overview

there are some great samples available for Snap Spectacles.  Most of these samples are extremely advanced.  Most apps will start with some basic components:

- splash screen
- a main menu
- about screen
- core in application screens
- some app assets
- simple touch/tap controls

The goal of this repo is to eventually design different apps that utilize all of the Spectacles Interaction Kit widgets so that one has an easy starting point for applications.
